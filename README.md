Fillarivahti is a city bike capacity service for the Helsinki region. It
currently only monitors the number of bikes on city bike stations. The goal
is to have a nice mobile interface to see at-a-glance what the capacity at
the nearest station is, and how it's trending.

Uses the great [Digitransit / HSL Routing API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/bicycling/)
for bike data.
